# Cooler Communiites
Community Event; Carbon Point Survey and Estimator

This app was a prototype to allow residents at community fairs to commit to carbon output lowering activites. It would then allow administrators to keep a tally of all these activities to see how much the community had committed to lowering their carbon output.
